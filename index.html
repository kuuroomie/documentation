                    The English Wikipedia is the primary[a] English-language edition
                    of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created by Jimmy Wales
                    and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, as Wikipedia's first edition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    English Wikipedia is hosted alongside other language editions by
                    the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization. Its
                    content is written independently of other editions[1] in various
                    varieties of English, aiming to stay consistent within articles. 
                    Its internal newspaper is The Signpost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    English Wikipedia is the most-read version of Wikipedia, accounting 
                    for 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining 
                    percentage split among the other languages. The English Wikipedia 
                    has the most articles of any edition, at 6,808,284 as of April 2024. 
                    It contains 10.8% of articles in all Wikipedias, although it lacks 
                    millions of articles found in other editions. The edition's 
                    one-billionth edit was made on January 13, 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    English Wikipedia, often as a stand-in for Wikipedia overall, has
                    been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, 
                    extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced degree of 
                    commercial bias. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, 
                    particularly gender bias against women and ideological bias. While 
                    its reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has 
                    improved over time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s and 
                    early 2020s, having become an important fact-checking site. English 
                    Wikipedia has been characterized as having less cultural bias than 
                    other language editions due to its broader editor base.

                    Editors of the English Wikipedia have pioneered some ideas as conventions, 
                    policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in 
                    some of the other languages. These ideas include "featured articles", the 
                    neutral-point-of-view policy, navigation templates, the sorting of short 
                    "stub" articles into sub-categories, dispute resolution mechanisms such 
                    as mediation and arbitration, and weekly collaborations.

                <p>
                    It surpassed six million articles on 23 January 2020. In November 2022, 
                    the total volume of the compressed texts of its articles amounted to 20 
                    gigabytes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021 by Ser 
                    Amantio di Nicolao (Steven Pruitt) who as of that date is the user with 
                    the highest number of edits on the English Wikipedia, at over four million. 
                    Currently, there are 6,808,284 articles created with 915,491 files. The 
                    encyclopedia is home to 10.8% of articles in all Wikipedias (down from more 
                    than 50% in 2003). The English Wikipedia currently has 47,208,148 registered 
                    accounts of which 862 are administrators.

                    The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007,

                    Over 1,100,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times. Over 30,000 
                    editors perform more than 5 edits per month, and over 3,000 perform more than 100 
                    edits per month.

                <p>
                    On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled "The Future of Wikipedia", 
                    cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation 
                    stating that "the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen 
                    by a third in seven years." The attrition rate for active editors in English 
                    Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics 
                    for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported 
                    that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month 
                    was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 
                    42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. 
                    The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by "sharp" comparison, was cited 
                    as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 
                    2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trend analysis published in The Economist presents Wikipedia in other languages 
                    (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a 
                    renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at 
                    approximately 42,000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The English Wikipedia has the Arbitration Committee (also known as ArbCom) that 
                    consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes 
                    between other editors of the online encyclopedia. It was created by Jimmy Wales on 
                    4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as 
                    owner of the site. When it was founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators 
                    divided into three groups of four members each.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2022, for English Wikipedia, Americans accounted for about 40% of active editors, 
                    followed by British and Indian editors accounting for about 10% of each, and Canadian 
                    and Australian at about 5%.

                            found to be editing his own Wikipedia article. According to public logs, he had 
                            made 18 edits to his biography, seven of which were alterations of information 
                            about whether Larry Sanger was a co-founder of Wikipedia. It was also revealed 
                            that Wales had edited the Wikipedia article of his former company, Bomis. "Bomis 
                            Babes", a section of the Bomis website, had been characterized in the article as 
                            "soft-core pornography", but Wales revised this to "adult content section" and 
                            deleted mentions of pornography. He said he was fixing an error, and did not 
                            agree with calling Bomis Babes soft porn. Wales conceded that he had made the 
                            changes, but maintained that they were technical corrections.

                            that such images violate the precepts of the religion. Protesters also organized

                            images. By February 7, approximately 100,000 people had signed the petition and 
                            the article had been protected from editing by non-registered users. Jay Walsh,

                <p>
                    A "WikiProject" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve 
                    Wikipedia. These groups may focus on a specific topic area (for example, women's history), 
                    a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). 
                    As of August 2022, the English Wikipedia had over 2,000 WikiProjects, for which activity 
                    varied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an 
                    assessment scale of the quality of articles. Articles are rated by WikiProjects. The range 
                    of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" 
                    (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter 
                    one of the quality classes: either "good article", "A" or the highest, "featured article". 
                    Of the about 6.5 million articles and lists assessed as of April 2022, more than 6,000 
                    (0.09%) are featured articles, and fewer than 4,000 (0.06%) are featured lists. One featured 
                    article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main page of Wikipedia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team has developed a table (shown below) that displays 
                    data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English Wikipedia. If an article 
                    or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiProjects, then the highest rating is 
                    used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart. The software auto-updates the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive 
                    work of a few editors. A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and 
                    concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.
